# notion-lock

Simple add-on for Notion that encrypts and decrypts plain text using a password.
It uses AES encryption in Browser, no data is send to any server during encryption or decryption. All runs locally on your machine memory ;D

It is only possible to recover the data by typing the text and the correct password used to encrypt the data. 
This allows for multiple passwords to be used for different text.
